Phase 3 brainstorm: Shader gallery

I want to create an interactive gallery of the generated shaders in a marimo notebook
The goal is to reflect on the shader generation journey as an artistic exploration side project


the proposed workflow for marimo
- connect to weight and bias tracing and fetch the data entries we need: generated GLSL, agent critique (query once and save locally)
- create a customized anywidget for showing my glsl (so no transformation is needed for the glsl in wnb) - should be published so other marimo users can import
- simple UI in marimo for browsing shaders and their critique

MVP
- Pull last 30 records from wnb and publish the marimo notebook
