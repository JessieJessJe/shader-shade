Particle Flow Reference (Prompt-Only Summary)

Core effect:
- Dense 2D field of soft particles that flow organically.

Key techniques:
- Grid-based particle placement (one per cell).
- Noise-driven displacement (smooth, organic motion).
- Neighbor cell sampling for overlap.
- Soft dot rendering with smoothstep falloff.
- Optional glow via single-pass falloff (no multipass).

Constraints:
- Single-pass fragment shader only.
- No Shadertoy buffers; use #version 330 and required uniforms.

Parameters to expose:
- Grid scale / density
- Particle radius / falloff
- Noise frequency / displacement strength
- Brightness / contrast
